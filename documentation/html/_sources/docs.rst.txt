Documentation Guide
######################

This documentation is written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.


Installing Sphinx
------------------

You will need the `sphinx documentation tool <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ and 
its `numpydoc extension <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc>`_ and `napoleon extension <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon>`_. 

Assuming you have the `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_ python package installer, 
you can easily install the required tools from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::

   >>> pip install Sphinx
   >>> pip install numpydoc
   >>> pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleon

Building the docs
------------------

cd to the root directory ``documentation``. If Sphinx is propery installed, you should be able to just run ``make html``::

    >>> make html
    [huge printout of compiling status informational messages]

    Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html

The documentation will be built to HTML and you can view it locally by opening ``documentation/_build/html/index.html`` 

You can also similarly build the documentation to PDF, LaTeX, Windows Help, or several other formats as desired. Use ``make help`` to see the available output formats. 

If there are structural changes made to the EXOSIMS directory (i.e., file/folder additions or deletions) you will need to run ``sphinx-apidoc``.  From the ``documentation`` directory run::

    sphinx-apidoc -f -o . ../EXOSIMS/

This will rebuild all of the ``EXOSIMS.*`` rst files, after which you can run ``make html`` to rebuild the html documentation. Note that this command also generates a ``modules.rst`` file that we do not use, and which can be safely deleted (but should not be added to the repository).


This entire procedure is also packaged into a bash script: ``builddocs.sh``.  On POSIX systems, you can just run this script from the documentation directory to rebuild and recompile everything and move the resulting html directory to the top level documentation directory. 

For Windows users, this procedure is packaged into a batch file: ``builddocs.bat``. You can run this file from the documentation directory to rebuild and recompile everything and move the build html directory to the top level documentation directory.
